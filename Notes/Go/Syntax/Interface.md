[Go] #Golang #GoSyntax 

An interface in Go is a **custom type** that defines a set of method signatures. It acts as a **contract**. Any other type that has all the methods listed in the interface's contract is said to "satisfy" or "implement" the interface.

Think of it as a blueprint for behavior. If a type can do everything the blueprint requires, it matches the blueprint.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Abstract Type:** An interface does not have an implementation; it only defines _what methods_ a type must have.
    
- **Contract:** It specifies a set of methods that a concrete type must implement.
    
- **Implicit Implementation:** Go uses structural typing. A type satisfies an interface automatically if it has all the required methods. No explicit `implements` keyword is needed.
    

## A Core Example: Shapes

Let's define a `Shape` interface that requires any implementing type to have an `Area()` method.

```
// 1. Define the interface (the contract)
type Shape interface {
    Area() float64
}
```

Now, we can create concrete types like `Rectangle` and `Circle`. They will satisfy the `Shape` interface by implementing the `Area()` method.

```
import "math"

// 2. Define concrete types
type Rectangle struct {
    Width  float64
    Height float64
}

type Circle struct {
    Radius float64
}

// 3. Implement the interface methods for each type
func (r Rectangle) Area() float64 {
    return r.Width * r.Height
}

func (c Circle) Area() float64 {
    return math.Pi * c.Radius * c.Radius
}
```

The power of the interface comes from writing functions that can accept any `Shape`, making the code flexible and reusable (**polymorphism**).

```
// This function works with any type that satisfies the Shape interface
func PrintArea(s Shape) {
    fmt.Printf("The area of this shape is %0.2f\n", s.Area())
}

func main() {
    rect := Rectangle{Width: 10, Height: 5}
    circ := Circle{Radius: 3}

    PrintArea(rect) // Works!
    PrintArea(circ) // Works!
}
```

## The Empty Interface: `interface{}`

The **empty interface**, written as `interface{}`, has no methods. Since it has no requirements, **every type in Go satisfies it automatically**.

This makes it a universal container that can hold a value of any type.

```
var container interface{}

container = 42           // An int
container = "hello"      // A string
container = true         // A boolean
```

### Type Assertions

To use the value stored in an empty interface, you must get its original type back. This is done with a **type assertion**. The safe way to do this is with the `, ok` idiom, which prevents a program crash (panic) if the type is not what you expect.

```
var container interface{} = "I am a string"

// Check if the container holds a string
s, ok := container.(string)
if ok {
    fmt.Printf("It's a string: %s\n", s)
} else {
    fmt.Println("It's not a string.")
}

// Check if it holds an int (it doesn't)
i, ok := container.(int)
if !ok {
    fmt.Println("It's not an int.")
}
```

### Type Switches

A **type switch** is a clean and idiomatic way to handle multiple possible types stored in an `interface{}`.

```
func checkType(i interface{}) {
    switch v := i.(type) {
    case int:
        fmt.Printf("It's an integer: %d\n", v)
    case string:
        fmt.Printf("It's a string: '%s'\n", v)
    default:
        fmt.Printf("It's an unknown type: %T\n", v)
    }
}
```

## Why Use Interfaces?

Interfaces are a cornerstone of idiomatic Go for several reasons:

- **Polymorphism:** Allows you to write functions that can operate on different types, as long as they share the required behavior.
    
- **Decoupling:** Reduces dependencies between different parts of your code. A function can depend on an interface, not a specific concrete type, making your code more modular and easier to test.
    
- **Flexibility & Reusability:** Code written with interfaces is easier to extend. You can introduce new types that satisfy an interface without changing the functions that use that interface.
