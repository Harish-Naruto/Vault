Go is **strictly typed language** which means that 
```
false != 0  //other language it is false == 0
```
since false is bool and  0 is int 
Go has bool type which contains only false and true

Go is a garbage collected language; you can safely return a pointer to a local variable it will only be cleaned up by the garbage collector when there are no active references to it.
