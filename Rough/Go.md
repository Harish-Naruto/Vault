- Go is **strictly typed language** which means that 
```
false != 0  //other language it is false == 0
```
	since false is bool and  0 is int 
	Go has bool type which contains only false and true

- Go is a garbage collected language; you can safely return a pointer to a local variable it will only be cleaned up by the garbage collector when there are no active references to it.
- In Go if a symbol (variables, types, functions et al) starts with a lowercase symbol then it is private _outside the package it's defined in_.
